# Welcome — I’m Erick Coll Rodríguez
### Purpose, discipline, and code

## Ambitious DAW Student | Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | Administrative Background | Applied AI Learner

I am an ambitious and disciplined professional currently studying Web Application Development (DAW), with a strong interest in software development, modern web technologies, and applied artificial intelligence.

Coming from the field of administration, I have developed a solid foundation in organization, responsibility, problem-solving, attention to detail, and structured work — skills that I now apply to my transition into the tech world.

I am currently building my knowledge in programming, backend and frontend development, operating systems, and real-world digital tools through hands-on projects and continuous learning. My goal is to grow into a versatile developer capable of building practical, scalable, and well-structured solutions.

At the same time, I am also exploring the practical use of AI in professional and creative environments, with a growing interest in corporate AI, workflow optimization, and AI-powered tools for content creation and digital productivity.
