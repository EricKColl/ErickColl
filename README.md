# Purpose, discipline, and code

## Ambitious DAW Student | Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | Administrative Background | Focused on Continuous Growth

I am an ambitious and disciplined professional currently studying Web Application Development (DAW), with a strong interest in software development and modern web technologies.  
Coming from the field of administration, I have developed a solid foundation in organization, responsibility, problem-solving, and attention to detail — skills that I now apply to my transition into the tech world.

I am currently building my knowledge in programming, backend and frontend development, and operating systems through hands-on projects and continuous learning. My goal is to grow into a versatile developer capable of building practical, scalable, and well-structured solutions.
